│ │                                                                          │ │
│ │ ## Enhanced Multi-Agent MCP Deployment Pipeline                          │ │
│ │                                                                          │ │
│ │ ### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Error Management                           │ │
│ │ - [ ] Build database for error-logging and resolution with deduplication,│ │
│ │ and categorization.			   											   │ │    │ │ - [ ] Implement simple but scalable error logging system (network,       │ │
│ │  resource, config, dependency)                                           │ │         
│ │ - [ ] Design simple, but effective isolation and rollback procedures for │ │
│ │ each agent                                                               │ │          
│ │																			       │ │
│ │ ### Phase 2: First Agent Deployment & Learning                           │ │
│ │ - [ ] Initialize agent for testing                                       │ │               
│ │ - [ ] Have agent deploy MCP server for terminal use with validation      │ │
│ │ gates                                                                    │ │
│ │ - [ ] immediately log errors in database and collaborate with Claude and │ │
│ │other agents on fixes until server is functional                          │ │      │ │- [ ] log successful resolution patterns into database                    │ │      
│ │                                                                          │ │
│ │ ### Phase 3: Further Agent Validation                                    │ │
│ │ - [ ] Initialize second agent and connect to terminal-use MCP with       │ │
│ │ independent validation												       │ │ │ │ - [ ] Initialize third agent and connect to terminal-use MCP with 		   │ │ │ │	independent validation                                                    │ │
│ │  - [ ] Have agents 2 and 3 deploy a different servers under the same     │ │
│ │ conditions as the first agent. Choose from remaining servers that are not yet │ │deployed.																	   │ │    │ │ - [ ] Agent 1 will be in charge of error and resolution logging while    │ │ │ │monitoring agents 2 and 3. 											       │ |
│ │ - [ ] Agent 1 will evaluate errors before conferring with us and helping agents 2 and 3.
    - [ ] Once flow is solid, Assign Agent #1 Orchestrator title.
│ │                                                                          │ │
│ │ ### Phase 4: Monitoring & Scaling                                        │ │
│ │ - [ ] Once flow has been established, initialize agents 4, 5, 6 and 7 with the same flow as established in Phase 3                                                │ │
│ │ - [ ] Continue to monitor and assist in completing tasks where needed.    │ │
│ │ - [ ] Once agent 2 completes the second server, assign it to monitor system resources. 
│ │ - [ ] Make sure to show agent #2 what the tools are and how to use them.                                                                           │ │
│ │ ---                                                                      │ │
│ │  Stretch Goals: Once basic functionality has been achieved, we will look at implementing the following:
 - [ ] Learning mechanism for resolution patterns
 - [ ] Build dynamic resource allocation and conflict detection 
 - [ ] Create agent state synchronization and mapping mechanisms
 - [ ] Build successful resolution patterns into reusable agent knowledgebase
│ │ - [ ] Create progress dashboards for visual monitoring of all agent      │ │
│ │ deployment status                                                        │ │
│ │ - [ ] Scale to all agents with concurrent terminal/server assignments    │ │
│ │ and conflict prevention
