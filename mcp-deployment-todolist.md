# MCP Deployment Todo List

## Enhanced Multi-Agent MCP Deployment Pipeline

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Error Management
- [ ] Build database for error-logging and resolution with deduplication and categorization
- [ ] Implement error classification system (network, resource, config, dependency)
- [ ] Create agent state synchronization and mapping mechanisms
- [ ] Design isolation and rollback procedures for each agent
- [ ] Build dynamic resource allocation and conflict detection

### Phase 2: First Agent Deployment & Learning
- [ ] Initialize agent for testing with learning mechanism for resolution patterns
- [ ] Have agent deploy MCP server for terminal use with validation gates
- [ ] Log errors in database and collaborate on fixes until server is functional
- [ ] Build successful resolution patterns into reusable agent knowledge base

### Phase 3: Second Agent Validation
- [ ] Initialize second agent and connect to terminal-use MCP with independent validation
- [ ] Have second agent deploy second server with error logging and rollback automation
- [ ] Verify collaborative error resolution flow is working with parallel validation

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Scaling
- [ ] Create progress dashboards for visual monitoring of all agent deployment status
- [ ] Scale to all agents with concurrent terminal/server assignments and conflict prevention
- [ ] Observe and document problem patterns with automated solution suggestions
